# Perceived-Gender-Differences-on-Love-
In psychology, exploring the concept of love presents significant challenges due to 
numerous extraneous variables and their inherent ambiguity. Introducing gender into this 
exploration adds further variability, making it even more complex to quantify and analyze. 
Despite these challenges, examining certain behavioral patterns can reveal trends that enhance 
our understanding of how gender influences perceptions of love. 

This study involves a sample of 50 individuals to examine the patterns of gender in 
relation to love. The participants, consisting of 19 males, 28 females, and 3 non-binary 
individuals, completed a quantitative questionnaire designed to probe various dimensions of 
love: physical, emotional, and psychological. They were asked to assess the importance of 
romantic feelings and to evaluate their own effectiveness in communicating and expressing love 
within a relationship.
